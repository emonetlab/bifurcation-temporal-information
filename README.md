## Description

This repository (https://github.com/emonetlab/bifurcation-temporal-information) provides the scripts and data to reproduce figures in our manuscript with short annotations.

Below is a short description of what each files and folders contain:

- *Figures/*: Folder containing Python scripts to reproduce figures in the manuscript, sorted by the figure numbers
- *SI Figures/*: Folder containing Python scripts to reproduce figures in the SI appendix, sorted by the figure numbers

Python scripts starting with `gen_<name>.py` runs simulations and analyses while Python scripts starting with `plot_<name>.py` plots figures. 

- *models/*: Folder containing Python scripts for models, signal generation, MI calculation, etc.
- *utils/*: Folder containing other miscellaneous functions

Within each subdirectory, there may be a folder named `data` which contains pre-computed outputs for computations that may take a long time to complete. The Python scripts prioritize using these pre-computed outputs, but the outputs can be regenerated by changing the **SAVE** flag which will re-run everything. ***WARNING -- THIS CAN TAKE A VERY LONG TIME!***

## Requirements

The scripts have been tested on Python 3.11.5. The following packages are necessary to run the code:

* NumPy (>=1.26.4)
* SciPy (>=1.12.0)
* matplotlib (>=3.8.2)
